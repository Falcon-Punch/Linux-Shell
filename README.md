# UNIX Shell

This is a project from an Operating Systems course during my junior year.
The project had 3 milestones. The first milestone was to figure out how to 
properly parse the command line and to store that data. The second milestone
was to implement the executing of applications with both arguments and/or as a 
background process. The last milestone required running piped processes as 
well as input / output redirection. Overall the project was really fun and 
I learned a lot about parent and child processes, interprocess communication
and fork(), exec(), pipe(), dup2(), and waitpid().

# Stretch Goals

The program seems pretty solid after a bunch of stress testing, the only thing
that seems to be missing is some color!
